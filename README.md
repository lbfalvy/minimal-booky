## Contributing

I'm happy to accept pull requests for additional functionality, even if I don't need it. You may be
asked to add a toggle though.

If you bump into a problem, you should make sure you can reliably reproduce it on a fresh browser
(firefox has profiles which are great for this) before submitting an issue with the steps and
browser version.

If you have an idea you want to discuss you should also do that in an issue. If I like it I may
just write it myself, if I don't, you can still submit a PR.
